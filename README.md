# **Wavin-AHC-9000-mqtt**

## **The Prpoject is currently under development!!!**

A Esp8266 mqtt interface for more Wavin AHC-9000 controllers connected together and controlled by one Wavin display.

The goal is to be able to control the Wavin AHC 9000 heating controllers from [OpenHAP](https://www.openhab.org/), and still be able to use the Wavin display as well.

### **Current project status**
The current version will controle two Wavin AHC-9000 controllers, initial installed and configured using the Wavin display. The Wavin display will not be working together with the Esp8266 mqtt interface in the current version.

### **History**

The propject is a git clone of https://github.com/dkjonas/Wavin-AHC-9000-mqtt.git but restructured for Firmware (FW), Software (SW) and Hardware (HW).

The project taking on the challange mentioned in [Issue #3](https://github.com/dkjonas/Wavin-AHC-9000-mqtt/issues/3#issuecomment-435690672)

##### "connect two AHC's together and control them by one display. I think this is rather unusual setup, so my code doesn't handle this case; It can only control one AHC."

### **Project planned to be**

One simple Esp8266 mqtt interface for Wavin AHC-9000/Jablotron AC-116, with the goal of being able to control two Wavin AHC 9000 heating controllers from [OpenHAP](https://www.openhab.org) automation software for your home.

The heating controllers will still be connected to one display, from where controle can be done as well.

The project include a [Kicad](https://www.kicad.org/) PCB layout and a docker based mosquitto broker based on [eclipse-mosquitto](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-mosquitto).

## **Esp8266 mqtt interface**

See the cloned Firmware markdown [here](Firmware/README.md).

## **Mosquitto broker**

### **Requirements**

- Raspberry Pi model B v1.2. Installed with Raspberry Pi OS Lite (32-bit) <span id="a1">[[1]](#f1)</span>.
- Internet access.
- Raspberry Pi hardened <span id="a2">[[2]](#f2)</span>.
- Docker Engin and Docker Compose installed <span id="a3">[[3]](#f3)</span>.


### **Create docker-compose file**

In folder `Wavin-AHC-9000-mqtt` create file `docker-compose.yaml`

```bash
vi docker-compose.yaml
```

Add the following contend:

```bash
# Docker-compose file for building Wavin-AHC-9000-mqtt program stack.

# Generel note about environment settings - see README.md file about .env file

version: '3.8'

services:
  mosquitto-mqtt:
  container_name: mosquitto-mqtt
  image: eclipse-mosquitto:2
  restart: always
  command: mosquitto -c /mosquitto-no-auth.conf
  ports:
    - 1883:1883
  volumes:
    - mosquitto-conf:/mosquitto/config
    - mosquitto-data:/mosquitto/data
    - mosquitto-log:/mosquitto/log

volumes:
  mosquitto-conf:
    name: mosquitto-conf
  mosquitto-data:
    name: mosquitto-data
  mosquitto-log:
    name: mosquitto-log

````

Before starting the docker container, create a .env file in the same directory as the docker-compose.yaml file.

```bash
vi .env
```

Add the following contend:

 ````bash
MQTT_SERVER='mosquitto-mqtt'        # MQTT Broke's hostname or IP Address (here the `mosquitto-mqtt` docker container name is used.)
MQTT_PORT=1883                      # MQTT Broker's port number. TCP/IP port 1883 is reserved with IANA for use with MQTT. 
                                    # TCP/IP port 8883 is also registered, for using MQTT over SSL.
MQTT_CLIENT_ID='webhook-subscriber' # Name used to identify the MQTT client.
NOTIFICATION_E_MAIL=*E-mail addres* # E-mail address to which notifications will be send
# If the one or more of the following environment variables is NOT set, e-mail notificatinos will NOT be send.
MQTT_POWERUP_NOTIFICATION='YES'     # IF set: Energy Meter Powerup notifications will be send. 
MQTT_DISCONNECT_NOTIFICATION='YES'  # IF set: Disconnect notifications will be send
MQTT_RECONNECT_NOTIFICATION='YES'   # IF set: Re-connect  notifications will be send
MQTT_ALIVE_NOTIFICATION=`YES`
````

Verify that the environment variables is succesfull read by docker compose.

````bash
docker compose config
````

 Start the docker container with `docker-compose up -d`.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Project development tasks

- Verify if the sp8266 mqtt interface can controle only one of the two heat controllers.
  - Currently the sp8266 mqtt interface addresses both controllers simultaneously. Meaning, setting a target temperature, it seems to be set for bothâ€¦ and the current temperature are read from both controllers, resulting in two different temperatures for the same channel...

A simple change to MODBUS_DEVICE in WavinController.h verified that each heat controller can be addressed and read. However the Wavin display stopped working.

 - Autodiscovery seems to have a problem in OpenHAB 3. Things are discoverd, but the channels are not.

**Two controllers on the same MODBUS seems to give a challange... It is NOT supported by the Modbus standard!**

|       | Module              | Version | Change
|---    |---                  | ----    |----
|       |                     | 0.0.1   | Initial commit. On-board LED at PIN 16 added to indicate active boot up. It turns off at successful connect to Wireless Lan. 
| FW    | WavinController.h   | 1.0.2   | MODBUS_DEVICE changed from = 0x01 to 0x02
| FW    | WavinController.h   | 1.0.3   | MODBUS_DEVICE changed from = 0x02 to 0x03
| FW    | WavinController.h   | 1.0.4   | Added MODBUS_DEVICES and NUMBER_OF_DEVIDES
| FW    | WavinController.cpp | 1.0.4   | Objects modified to handle MODBUS_DEVICE as an argument instad of fixed value.
| FW    | All modules         | 1.0.4   | Calls to objects, which has changed because of the objects being modified for handle MODBUS_DEVICE as an argument. MQTT Publish functions has been added Modbus Device.
